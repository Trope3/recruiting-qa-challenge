The first thing to do in this particluar case is to start the application in your local computer. Follow these instractions to start the app:

1) Launch your window cmd console and cd to the following folder <<CHOSEN FOLDER LOCATION>>\Docker\recruiting-qa-challenge-master
2) Run the command "docker-compose up" to start the app

3) cd to the client "package.json" file location folder <<CHOSEN FOLDER LOCATION>>\Docker\recruiting-qa-challenge-master\client
3) Run the following command to start the client "npm run serve"

Now to test the application, I decided to use a test framework called Cypress. Watch this video to install and setup Cypress in your local machine 
=> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F53rDUwiAbU&list=PLUDwpEzHYYLu4jKg-rNSKH3aJeBinlPXp&index=3

Once Cypress is set up in your local computer, move the "TropeeAutomatedTests.js" file to the following folder, <<Your Cypress FOLDER PROJECT>>\cypress\integration\examples. 
In case the "examples" folder doesnÂ´t exist, move the "TropeeAutomatedTests.js" file to the <<Your Cypress FOLDER PROJECT>>\cypress\integration\ folder

Then Copy and paste these Json keys in the cypress.json file:

{
    "chromeWebSecurity": false,
    "videoCompression": 15
}


How to run the Test Cases

1) Open Visual Studio Code
2) Select your <<Cypress Project>> folder
3) Run the following command to launch the Test Runner console -> .\node_modules\.bin\cypress open
4) After a couple of seconds, when the Test runner console is shown in the screen, click on "TropeeAutomatedTests.js"
5) The test results will be displayed in the Test Runner console
